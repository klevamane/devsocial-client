1. create an img folder in src/img
2. Install react, and  redux devtools on chrome.
3. add font awesome, bootstrap, bootstrap js cdns
4. Add Navbar, landing and footer components
5. In the App.js Add react router as Browser router, also add Router all from react-router-dom
6.To create component state; in a component class, add, the 
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.state = {

        }
    }

7. Add state to the register component, by linking the name and onChange event with the this.setState = {
    
}


9. Add proxy in package.json
    "proxy": "http://localhost:5000",
10. npm install classnames - to implement conditional classnames
    this will ensure that we can easily add classes / class to the form control
    if a particular condition is met

    eg
    className={classnames("form-control form-control-lg", {
                      'is-invalid': errors.name
                    })} 

    display "form-control form-control-lg" at all times , but add 'is-valid' to the 
    className if and only if errors.name exist

    this in this case will help us to add highlight to the input

11. you can add noValidate to the formtag, to prevent the form from implementing any
    HTML 5 validation.

12. add {errors.confirmpwd && (<div className="invalid-feedback">{errors.confirmpwd}</div>)}
        use for different controll names eg, password, email etc.
        this ensures that if there the error object contains error, it displays it
        at the position this is placed

13. npm install redux, react-redux and redux-thunk
    When an Ajax request is, we want to wait for that request and then dispatch to our reducer.
    Redux-thunk essentially enables that to be done.
